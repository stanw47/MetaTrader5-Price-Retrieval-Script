# MetaTrader5-Price-Retrieval-Script
This will give you data from GBPUSD and GBPJPY. 
I like this because it reminds me of looking at level 2 data in the US Stock Market, and all of the auxillary charts you get from the stock market too. 
This is using the Anaconda3 Environment to run, along with MetaTrader5
You get 20,000 ticks of data that streams like a waterfall from:
January 20,2020 to March 18, 2020.

This is useful for the reason that you get a very good idea of the average price, how often the price has deviated from it,
and whether or not the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the GBPUSD currency pair at all.

Knowing who's currency did the worst lets you know who's suffering the most. In this case, it's America. Volatility is high.
